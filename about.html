         <section id="About me"
          <h2> About Me</h2>
          <p>I was born on February 19, 2004, in Istanbul. I completed my primary and middle school education in the schools in my neighborhood. I began high school in 2014 and attended Başakşehir Fine Arts High School, one of Istanbul's prestigious art schools. Although I was accepted to the digital art school called Focal Point School in Poland, opened by Darek Zabrocki in 2020, I couldn't start my education due to my family's financial constraints after graduating from high school.</p>
          <p> Since 2020, I have been collaborating with the Illustrator Platform, an organization based in Turkey. I participated in exhibitions as a volunteer, and my works were showcased. I also participated as an artist in XR Evenist organized by the art collective Base Istanbul, where I collaborated on projects in the fields of VR and AR. Additionally, I had the opportunity to sell my works in the form of NFT models, receiving widespread acclaim.</p>

            <h2>Motivation Letter</h2>
            <p>My name is Yusuf Samet Aydın, and I was born on February 19, 2004, in Istanbul, Turkey. It is crucial to note my origin as it greatly influences my art. My parents, originally from Malatya, a city in the eastern part of Turkey, migrated to Istanbul. Malatya, comprising both Turks and Kurds, including my father, has faced challenges stemming from terrorist acts by the Kurdish population since the Republic of Turkey's establishment. This has led to negative attitudes towards Kurdish people, impacting the region with issues like sexual assault, child marriages, drug trafficking, and hindrance to girls' education. <p></p>
            <p>However, my family's migration to Istanbul allowed my sister and me to distance ourselves from this socio-cultural climate. While my sister studies at Istanbul's top literature university, I pursued art education in high school. Despite being unable to attend university due to Turkey's economic situation, I work as a waiter to support my family, all the while staying dedicated to my art, including paintings, illustrations, and music.</p>
            <p>Having met numerous artists and curators in Turkey, I aim not for admiration but to convey a message. My confidence stems from my mother, who advised me not to lose my essence. Reflecting on this, I realize my essence lies in my cultural heritage, currently on the verge of extinction. I feel obliged to preserve it and shed light on the issues in the East, such as criminal acts and sexual assaults. My mission is to convey these realities to Western society through my art. </p>
            <p>Viewing my artistic journey as a project, I find it necessary to leave Turkey due to its political and economic restrictions. The 20-year rule of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has oppressed minority groups, Kurds, non-Muslims, and LGBT individuals. The aftermath of the Maraş earthquake is ongoing, with affected people forced to live in tents. I actively participate in relief campaigns.</p>
            <p>As a Muslim Turkish-Kurdish youth, I represent a philosophy termed "progressive conservatism." I aspire to reinterpret the conservative Middle Eastern culture with a progressive perspective, inspiring people without alienating them from their own culture. My project, symbolized by "Nemrutun Kızı" (Daughter of Nemrut), draws inspiration from a folk song in my hometown, representing a female figure akin to sculptures on Mount Nemrut.</p>
